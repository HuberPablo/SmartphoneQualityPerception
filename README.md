# SmartphoneQualityPerception
In this case study, we conducted a comprehensive factor analysis to understand customer perceptions of smartphone quality. Together with Oscar Wieland, we analyzed survey data from over 1,000 respondents to identify key dimensions that influence perceived quality, willingness to pay a premium, and repurchase intentions. Our analysis revealed that factors such as performance, durability, and aesthetics significantly influence overall quality perception. The regression analysis showed that performance was the strongest predictor of willingness to pay a premium, while ease of use had the most substantial impact on repurchase intentions. We also observed brand-specific differences, with Apple scoring higher on aesthetics and prestige, while Samsung excelled in features and durability. These insights provided actionable recommendations for enhancing product quality and customer satisfaction across different smartphone brands.
